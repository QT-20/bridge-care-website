    <h1>Welcome to Bridge Care</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Mission Statement:</strong> Bridge Care is dedicated to bridging the healthcare access gap by providing long-term, mobile medical and mental health services to rural and underserved communities across America. Our mission is to ensure that no individual is left behind when it comes to receiving essential healthcare.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
      Millions of Americans are still without proper access to healthcare, especially those living in rural or economically disadvantaged areas. Bridge Care tackles this issue by offering mobile clinics staffed with medical professionals that deliver ongoing physical and mental health support. Unlike temporary pop-up clinics, Bridge Care returns regularly, builds community trust, and integrates telehealth services to broaden access. We partner with local hospitals, organizations, and donors to create lasting, affordable solutions.

    <h2>About Bridge Care</h2>
    <p>
      Bridge Care was born out of the need to provide affordable, consistent healthcare access for low-income families, rural citizens, and people living with disabilities. Inspired by gaps in existing organizations like Remote Area Medical and The Health Wagon, our organization combines physical and mental healthcare into one traveling service. With consistent community visits, culturally competent care, and local partnerships, Bridge Care becomes a reliable part of every community it serves.
